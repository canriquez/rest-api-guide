# Rails REST API Simple TDD practice

Small TDD driven practice app to build a Rails RESTful API.
- Cointains API controller for :users
- Includes full rpesc test for basic API CURD
- No authentication features included so dar (I plan to include them at later stage)
- Planned to be a simple boiler plate for future applications

## Technologies used

* Rails 6.0.3.3
* Ruby: 2.6.5
* Postgresql: 1.2.3
* Factory Bot Rails 

## Database Requirements
- Application runs in development environment with a Postgresql DB
- Please install pd DB, and create a user/pass for development account.
- app user pre configured: ``` devuser ```
- It is highly recommended to store you passord in an environment variable at login. In developement environment I use the same password for all my apps. In my case I have a macos environment and I use this command to load the password in the ``` .bash_profile ```

```
echo 'export APPNAME_DATABASE_PASSWORD="PostgreSQL_Role_Password"' >> ~/.bash_profile

```

- Configurations must be hosted @ ``` /config/database.yml ``` 

#### /config/database.yml

``` 

  username: devuser
  password: <%= ENV['APPNAME_DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %>

```



### Bundle Installation 
- Clone Repository
